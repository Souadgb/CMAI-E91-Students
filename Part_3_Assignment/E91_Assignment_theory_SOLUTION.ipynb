    "\n",
    "If Eve intercepts and measures **100%** of the Bell pairs, what CHSH value would you expect?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) $|S|\\approx 2\\sqrt{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "B) $|S|\\le 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "C) $|S|\\approx 2.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:** B\n",
    "\n",
    "If Eve measures 100% of the pairs, the CHSH value would be **|S| ≤ 2** (within the classical limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- When Eve measures, she collapses the quantum superposition\n",
    "- The entanglement is destroyed - Alice and Bob no longer share entangled pairs\n",
    "- Instead, they effectively have classical, local correlations\n",
    "- Classical systems are bounded by Bell's inequality: |S| ≤ 2\n",
    "- The CHSH test would show values around |S| ≈ 2 or lower, signaling that the quantum channel has been compromised"

    "Alice and Bob run the E91 protocol and measure **S = 2.1**.  \n",
    "Should they use the key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Yes — any $S > 2$ is considered secure  \n",
    "B) No — it is too close to the classical limit  \n",
    "C) Yes — but only if they discard half of the key"

    "**Correct:** B\n",
    "\n",
    "**No, they should NOT use the key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "- The classical limit is |S| = 2, and S = 2.1 is only slightly above this\n",
    "- An ideal quantum system should give |S| ≈ 2√2 ≈ 2.83\n",
    "- A value of 2.1 suggests possible eavesdropping activity (partial interception)\n",
    "- It could also indicate significant channel noise\n",
    "- Either way, the key's security cannot be guaranteed\n",
    "- In practice, E91 implementations set a threshold well above 2 (e.g., 2.5 or higher) to account for statistical fluctuations while still detecting attacks"

    "Why does the E91 protocol use a combination of **same** and **different** measurement bases?\n",

    "**SOLUTION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:** A\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why different bases:**\n",
    "- Key generation needs **perfectly correlated/anti-correlated** results → same basis (90°-90° in our case)\n",
    "- The CHSH test needs **non-aligned bases** to detect quantum correlations that violate Bell inequality\n",
    "- The CHSH formula uses specific basis combinations: (0°,45°), (0°,135°), (90°,45°), (90°,135°)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If they used the same bases for both:**\n",
    "- With matching bases: 100% correlation but no CHSH test possible (all terms would be the same)\n",
    "- With CHSH bases only: Could do Bell test but key bits wouldn't perfectly match\n",
    "- The separation is necessary to serve both purposes: security verification AND key generation"
